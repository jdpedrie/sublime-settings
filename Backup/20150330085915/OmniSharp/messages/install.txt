Welcome to OmniSharpSublime!

You can now edit C#, build your projects, run your tests, get intellisense, refactor like a pro, be shown syntax errors and lots more!

For more information see the README and Wiki here: https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-sublime

Important! 
If you are running on Windows, make sure Python is installed and added to your PATH. 
You can get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/. After installing, execute the following command to add Python to the PATH:
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\Python27 (or a different location, depending on where you installed Python)
